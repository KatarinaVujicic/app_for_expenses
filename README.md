Application was made by me for my final exam.
Application alows managing people in the company and also alows employers to manage their expenses which are made with the company money.

It is actually Java EE application which is made using JavaServerPages and Java Servlets, also EJB's are used to connect with the database. Also Bootstrap was used in the project.


Here you can see some of the screenshots of the project.
